## CHANGELOG

### Additions

- Travelling Gear dependency has been removed
- Primordial Weapons are now activated on `Shift+Use`
- All the special armors you must unequip and use `Shift+Right Click` them to switch the elemental aspect until a better system if found
- Spectral Cloak will work automatically when worn and cannot be enabled/disabled like before
- All WG Travelling Gear baubles are equipped as regular Baubles
- Terrestrial transformer has an additional Magical Forest focus
- `[WG]` has been removed from all entries
- Fixed bag duplication bug
- Gauntlet can now pick up custom Aura Nodes (ex Gadomancy)
- Ring of the Sniper has been fixed
- Cloak of the Raven feels incredibly smooth and fun to use
- Seraph Shoulder double jumping can no longer be spammed by holding Jump and feels better and has higher jump
- Added new ores like Octine, Syrmorite
- Gem effects have been improved and expanded, BOP gems supported, Gauntlet effects also adjusted to match
  - The idea was to make point cut more aggressive and oval cut more utility (earth being the only exception to this rule)
      - Point Cut
          - Fire: use = damage boost (used to place a temp light), added shift+use = set target on fire
          - Water: use = same as before turns lava->obsidian and water->ice but no longer turns flowing lava to cobble
          - Earth: use = same as before knockback resistance plus added also regular resistance, effects last longer
          - Entropy: use = changed to add night vision and warp (used to only give warp)
      - Oval Cut
          - Fire: use = places a number of random temporary lights (used to block projectiles)
          - Order: use = just as before teleports but it has been slightly tweaked
      - Note: with the above changes Gauntlet can be incredibly strong late game melee weapon in conjunction with fire and earth point gems
- Re-enabled a previously disabled block Frost Extruder which produces snowballs (also fixed the model to look nice)
- Added Soulbound enchantment (from KryptonMaster)
- Added Scarecrow Golem, a vanilla like Golem that looks like a scarecrow skeleton with a pumpkin head, that can be given weapons to fight with but only by the owner
- Spinning wheel has been reorganized all the clothing items to make more sense

### Issues
- Cloak of Voluminous pockets doesn't work properly anymore after removing Travellers Gear dependency
- Cloak of storage has been disabled
